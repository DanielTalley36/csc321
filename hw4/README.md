''' This is a DNSlook up script for python'''

This python script reads the domains.tsv file extracts the domains (column 1) performs a forward dnslookup and outputs back the domain name and ip together in a graph.

To run simply open the DNSlookup.py file and run in the hw4 folder

I attempted for a good while to figure out the reverse DNS lookups, however, I repeatedly got a no host name found error for several of the ip address. Would work well with just one or two I would pick to test but not all.
